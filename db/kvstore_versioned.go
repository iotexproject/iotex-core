	// KvVersioned is a versioned key-value store, where each key has multiple
	// versions of value (corresponding to different heights in a blockchain)
	//
	// Versioning is achieved by using (key + 8-byte version) as the actual
	// storage key in the underlying DB. For each bucket, a metadata is stored
	// at the special key = []byte{0}. The metadata specifies the bucket's name
	// and the key length.
	//
	// For each versioned key, the special location = key + []byte{0} stores the
	// key's metadata, which includes the following info:
	// 1. the version when the key is first created
	// 2. the version when the key is lastly written
	// 3. the version when the key is deleted
	// 4. the key's last written value (to fast-track read of current version)
	// If the location does not store a value, the key has never been written.
	//
	// How to use a versioned key-value store:
	//
	// db := NewKVStoreWithVersion(cfg) // creates a versioned DB
	// db.Start(ctx)
	// defer func() { db.Stop(ctx) }()
	//
	// kv := db.SetVersion(5)
	// value, err := kv.Get("ns", key) // read 'key' at version 5
	// kv = db.SetVersion(8)
	// err := kv.Put("ns", key, value) // write 'key' at version 8

	KvVersioned interface {
		lifecycle.StartStopper

		// Version returns the key's most recent version
		Version(string, []byte) (uint64, error)

		// SetVersion sets the version, and returns a KVStore to call Put()/Get()
		SetVersion(uint64) KVStore
	}
