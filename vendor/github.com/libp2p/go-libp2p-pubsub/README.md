> A pubsub system with flooding and gossiping variants.

This is the canonical pubsub implementation for libp2p.

We currently provide three implementations:
- floodsub, which is the baseline flooding protocol.
- gossipsub, which is a more advanced router with mesh formation and gossip propagation.
  See [spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub) and  [implementation](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/blob/master/gossipsub.go) for more details.
- randomsub, which is a simple probabilistic router that propagates to random subsets of peers.
