# ioctl
ioctl is a command-line interface for interacting with IoTeX blockchains.

# Build
`./buildcli.sh`


If you want to build ioctl on Windows, you need to install mingw. Package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) provides an easy way to intall latest mingw.
`C:\Windows\system32> choco install mingw`


After this command, target bin files will be placed in ./release/ folder, upload them to
specific release so install-cli.sh can download them.

# Install
## Install released build
    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/master/install-cli.sh | sh

## Install latest build
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/master/install-cli.sh | sh -s "unstable"
