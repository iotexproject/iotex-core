# Start dev env as easy as possible

```
./setup.sh     # Install, set up, configure, create some test accounts and finally start the service
./setup.sh -q  # Same as ./setup.sh, but not build image
./setup.sh -c  # Clean all data except image
./contrl stop  # Stop the server
./contrl start # Start the server
```
