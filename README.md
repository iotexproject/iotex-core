## What is IoTeX?

IoTeX is the modular infrastructure for DePIN projects to deploy in full or integrate modules into existing frameworks. Please visit [IoTeX homepage](https://iotex.io) official website to learn more about IoTeX network.

## What is DePIN?

DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, a new approach to building and maintaining physical world infrastructure. This infrastructure can range from WiFi hotspots in wireless networks to solar-powered home batteries in energy networks. DePINs are developed in a decentralized manner by individuals and companies globally, making them accessible to everyone. In return, contributors receive financial compensation and an ownership stake in the network theyâ€™re building and the services they provide through token incentives. DePINs are enabled by widespread internet connectivity and advancements in blockchain infrastructure and cryptography. To learn more about DePIN, please visit [What is DePIN?](https://iotex.io/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin/).

### Explore DePIN Projects?

[DePIN Scan](https://depinscan.io/)  is the go-to explorer for DePIN projects. DePIN Scan tracks crypto token prices, real-time device data, and offers a variety of views for DePIN projects.

## Run a delegate?

Please visit [IoTeX Delegate Manual](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-bootstrap) for detailed setup process.

## Building the source code

### Minimum requirements

| Components | Version | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| [Golang](https://golang.org) | &ge; 1.18.5 | Go programming language |
| [Protoc](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) | &ge; 3.6.0 | Protocol buffers, required only when you rebuild protobuf messages |

### Compile

Download the code to your desired local location (doesn't have to be under `$GOPATH/src`)
```
git clone git@github.com:iotexproject/iotex-core.git
cd iotex-core
```

If you put the project code under your `$GOPATH\src`, you will need to set up an environment variable
```
export GO111MODULE=on
set GO111MODULE=on (for windows)
```

Build the project for general purpose (server, ioctl) by

```
make
```

Build the project for broader purpose (server, ioctl, injector...) by
```
make all 
```

If the dependency needs to be updated, run

```
go get -u
go mod tidy
```
If you want to learn more advanced usage about `go mod`, you can find out [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

Run unit tests only by

```
make test
```

Build the docker image by

```
make docker
```

### Run iotex-core

Start (or resume) a standalone server to operate on a blockchain by

```
make run
```

Restart the server from a clean state by

```
make reboot
```

If "make run" fails due to corrupted or missing state database while block database is in normal condition, e.g.,
failing to get factory's height from underlying DB, please try to recover state database by

```
make recover
```

Then, "make run" again.

### Use CLI

Users could interact with iotex blockchain by

```
ioctl [command]
```

Refer to [CLI document](https://docs.iotex.io/developer/ioctl/install.html) for more details.

## Contribution
We are glad to have contributors out of the core team; contributions, including (but not limited to) style/bug fixes,
implementation of features, proposals of schemes/algorithms, and thorough documentation, are welcomed. Please refer to
our [contribution guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more
information. Development guide documentation is [here](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/wiki/Developers%27-Guide).

For any major protocol level changes, we use [IIP](https://github.com/iotexproject/iips) to track the proposal, decision
and etc.
